## Description

Make a table to sort all your employee. Im too tired to explain, you will see

### Code Explain

Most of components are copy and pasted from the activities and the API come from the hint me so I wont explain much. I set three status,

search: changed when you type in someone in the input box, it will be used to filter the data and find your employee by their first and/or second name

data: the status which holds the data from the api

refresh: my 200 IQ hacky way to force the React component to refresh everytime you sort the table by name, email or phone

Sort table by name, email or phone by clicking on it

Rest are pretty self explanatory
